# Data301-Project
Final Project for Data301 (2022)

The Project Question was:
"What are the most interesting pairings of types of events in the month of January in the
past 3 years where an organisation, government, person/s etc from the United states is involved
as the main actor in the event?."

"Final Report DATA301.pdf" is the final report detailing all information, results, and conclusions surrounding the project

The file "Final_Code_DATA301.ipynb" was run on Google Colaboratory with slight adjustments to gather and cleanup data to get results

The Project used Market Basket Analysis, PySpark, Google Cloud Clusters and Buckets, and the GDELT 2.0 Dataset.
